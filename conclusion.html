          <p> From our visualization of highway vs city efficiency, the effect of cylinders on miles per gallon, and the relationship between fuel type 
              and fuel efficiency, we have explored the three questions originally posed at the beginning of this interactive slideshow. <br><br>
    
              To summarize, we learned that:
    
              <ul>
                <li> Cars with high city efficiencies tend to have good highway efficiencies as well, and electric cars in general seem more efficient. </li>
                <li> Electric cars' fuel efficiency is measured as MPGe, which takes into account the number of miles driven using the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.</li>
                <li> The more cylinders the engine has, the lower the fuel efficiency (not counting electric cars, as they have 0 cylinders). </li>
              </ul>
    
              Finally, here are some good resources if you are interested in learning more about fuel efficiency:
